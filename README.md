# Blackjack
## Python Program for Command Line Blackjack Simulator.

Blackjack is a standard casino card game, and this project is a Python program that simulates it. This program allows for multiple players to play, with player options to hit, stay, or double down. It includes variable settings for the number of decks used, Blackjack payout rate, and reshuffle card position. Players are individually given the option to leave the game at the end of each round allowing the remaining players to continue. This project makes use of classes to represent both the dealer and player characters.
